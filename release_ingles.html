        Week:end</font><br>
        </strong>from June 24th to 27th<strong><br>
        </strong><br>
        This weekend ('findE') is going to reflect upon Autolabs, tactical media 
        labs in free software that were realized during six months in three districts 
        of Sao Paulo's east zone: ermelino matarazzo, itaquera and s&atilde;o 
        miguel paulista. The experience talks about new forms of media production 
        with independent groups, inserted in a public politics context. The weekend 
        also aims to give a broad panorama of similar projects from Holland (N5M/Proxyvision), 
        Italy (Telestreet), France (Bureau D'Etudes) and England (Furtherfield). 
        <br>
        <br>
        Works produced during Autolabs are also going to be presented alongside 
        free software media production workshops. Divided between presentation 
        of works, a tour around the labs, debates and workshops-interventions 
        at the city centre, the workshops instructors and guests will show some 
        of the works produced at the labs, and will talk about their experiences 
        on independent media production, radio and web streaming, net.art, forms 
        and tools for online collaboration, free software, besides media activism 
        and social-cultural mobilization. <br>
        <br>
        On the 24th and 25th of june the activities will happen at Itaquera with 
        bands, presentation of works produced in Autolabs, workshops on video, 
        activist media and posters plus a web radio broadcasting the whole event. 
        (link to be published here on the day). On the 26th and 27th the focus 
        is the city center, gathering national and international guests such as 
        David Garcia and Brian Holmes in an <a href="dinamica_ingles.html">online 
        jam</a> with guests and public present at the venue to discuss presentially 
        and through this audio-visual web environment the issues mentioned above. 
        This virtual interface will also accommodate translocal interactions and 
        will be fed by an navigator that will present before each section the 
        context of the projects and related links. <br>

        The weekend wants to make visible the tactical dialog between centre and 
        periphery that was concretized during Autolabs and the non-territorialized, 
        collaborative and independent logic of a networked media production. <strong>Let's 
        co-laborate !</strong><br>
