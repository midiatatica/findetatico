    <td><p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here follows 
        a proposal to the <strong>Tactical Week:end </strong>in SESC Vila Mariana: 
        an informal conversation that is able to allow and stimulate spontaneous 
        interactions in a kind of <em>real-virtual jam</em>.<br>
        <br>
        6 computers will be at the stage of the auditorium running linux, so that 
        the public present, table participants and national and international 
        guests can upload to a common environment images (.jpgs), animations (.swfs) 
        and audios (.mp3). In fact, anyone connected to the web can upload material. 
        This material will inhabitate the program Visitor's Studio from the group 
        of British net.artists Furtherfield <a href="http://www.furtherfield.org" target="_blank">http://www.furtherfield.org</a>. 
        The idea is that the Brazilian tactical media crew apropiate this software 
        to converse in images and sounds about relevant themes and that the *visit* 
        can open the talks even further.<br>
        <br>
        Each guest will develop with the other participants a dynamic for his/her 
        table. This will be from inviting international guests to interact with 
        them via Furtherfield's software to propose themes to be discussed. <br>
        <br>
        To interact with the guests and the public, the address is&gt; <a href="http://www.furtherstudio.org/live">http://www.furtherstudio.org/live</a> 
        Please check the <a href="programa_ingles.html">times</a> of the tables! 
        S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil is (GMT -3). <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Furtherfield.org<br>
        How it works?</strong><br>
        <br>

        and colaborators can interact with each other. Register in 'Visitor's 
        Studio' with a name, password and e-mail. This software will be used as 
        a virtual environment to accomodate translocal and multimedia interaction 
        between theparticipants and guests of the Tactical Week:end, present in 
        s&atilde;o paulo or not.</font></p>
